## Don't try
- Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn't neccessarily mean they're the same thing.
- Giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business, but giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health.
- The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Subtlety </mark>
	1. Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
	2. Subtlety #2: To not give about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
	3. Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.
## Happiness is a problem
- The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People who abstains from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention. This isn't to say that all suffering is equal. Some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering.<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> But we all must suffer nonetheless.</mark>
- There is a premise which we assump and belief that if I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y then I can be happy. If I can be with person Z then I will be happy. This premise is the problem, happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and necessary components to creating happiness.
- Problems are a constant in life, and happiness comes from solving those problems. You take action to solve problems, it will lay the foundation for tomorrow's problems, and so on. True happiness accurs only when you find the problems you can feel good about.
- Question yourself, what do you want and what pain do you want in your life. Because there will no free lunch, you want something you will suffer for it, so choose wisely.
- Emotions are overrated. People suffers from what they want, and emotional are the feedback mechanisms telling they that something is either likely right or likely wrong, and it is a part of the equation but not all. Just something feels good doesn't mean it is good, just becase somethjjing feels bad doesn't mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not command. Therefore, we shouldn't always trust our emotions and always question them.
- You could fuck things up at least one of 2 ways:
	- Denial: you can deny the reality, in short term it feels good, but it leads to insecurity, neuroticism and emotional repression.
	- Victim mentality: you always blame the others, outside circumstances which you feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, helplessness and despair. 
## You are not special
- Accept who you are, and you're just a normal person in this world.
- We live in the internet era, where people telling others the "high self-esteem", you are special, but the reality this is just a delutional inovation for everyone.
- You will have a growing appreciation for life's basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, craeting something, helping a prerson in need, reading a book, loughing with someone you care about, because they are what actually matters.
## The value of suffering
- You will always suffer, so the real question is why am I suffering for what purpose?
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Shitty values:</mark>
	- Pleasure
	- Material success
	- Always being right
	- Staying positive
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Good values:</mark>
	- Reality based
	- Socially constructive
	- Immediate and controllable
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Bad values:</mark>
	- Supertitious
	- Socially destructive
	- Not immediate or controllable
## You are always choosing
- We are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always.
- There is no such thing as not giving a single fuck. We must all give a fuck about something. To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something.
- What are we choosing to give a fuck about? What values are we choosing to base our actions on? What metrics are we choosing to use to measure our life? And are those good choices, values, metrics?
- You don't get to choose problems, problem choose you, but it's your responsibility to response to the problems which eventually lead to you if choose negative response it will give you negative problem because problems create problems. So choose how to response to get the most out of your problem, even you don't response it's still a response, and you are already choosing.
- We all love to take responsibility for success and happoness. Hell, we often fight over who gets to be responsible for success and happiness. But taking responsibility for our problems is far more important, because that's where the real learning comes from. That's where the real-life improvement comes from. To simply blame others is only to hurt yourself.
## You are wrong about everything
- When you learn something you don't go from wrong to right, you go from wrong to less wrong. Life is elssly iterative process, you are always in thje process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.
- Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened—and even then, it’s still debatable. That’s why accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place. Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are. Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Be careful what you believe.</mark>
	- But perhaps the answer is to trust yourself _less._ After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations _more._ If we’re all wrong, all the time, then isn’t self-skepticism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress?

	- This may sound scary and self-destructive. But it’s actually quite the opposite. It’s not only the safer option, but it’s liberating as well.
- The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.
	-  We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don’t mean to, that’s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we’re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I’m a nice guy, I’ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I’m an awesome cook, I’ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.
	- In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.
	- I say _don’t_ find yourself. I say _never_ know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.
- Kill youself: Buddhism argues that your idea of who “you” are is an arbitrary mental construction and that you should let go of the idea that “you” exist at all; that the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you, and thus you’re better off letting go of everything. In a sense, you could say that Buddhism encourages you to not give a fuck.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">How to be a little less certain of yourself?</mark>
	- Question #1: What if I'm wrong?
	- Question #2: What would it mean if I were wrong?
	- Question #3: Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
## Failure is the way forward
- Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.
- Pain is part of the process
- Don’t just sit there. _Do_ something. The answers will follow.
- Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Action → Inspiration → Motivation.</mark>
-  Do something. It can be anything.
## The importance of saying no
- Create a boundary for things you don't give a fuck.
- The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things:
	- How well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility
	- The willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.
- By “boundaries” I mean the delineation between two people’s responsibilities for their own problems. People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner’s problems.
- Trust is like a china plate. If you break it once, with some care and attention you can put it back together again. But if you break it again, it splits into even more pieces and it takes far longer to piece together again. If you break it more and more times, eventually it shatters to the point where it’s impossible to restore. There are too many broken pieces, and too much dust.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Less is more.</mark>
- Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would.
- In this way, the rejection of alternatives liberates us—rejection of what does not align with our most important values, with our chosen metrics, rejection of the constant pursuit of breadth without depth.
- Yes, breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you’re young—after all, you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried. And you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle—in everything.
##  ... And then you die
- "This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death. The more I peer into the darkness, the brighter life gets, the quieter the world becomes, and the less unconscious resistance I feel to, well, anything."
