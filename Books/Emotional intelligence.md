> "Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy"

### Part 1: The emotional brain
1. Chapter 1: What are emotions for?
	- When passions overwhelm reason: 
		- Everytimes emotion makes a decision, it is the instinct of the hunman. Through time, it was developed through survival and till now it is not keeping up with the modern world.
	- Impules to action:
		- Anger
		- Fear
		- Happiness
		- Love
		- Surprise
		- Disgust
		- Sadness
	- Our two minds:
		- Rational : the logical brain
		- Emotional mind: the heart
	- How did your brain grew?
2. Anatomy of an Emotional hjacking
	- The seat of all passion
		- In hunmans, the amygdala (from the Greek word for "almond") is an almond-shape cluster of interconnected structyures perched above the brainstem. If hunman lost amydala, they can no longer have feeling for others and all the passions.
	- The neural tripwire
		- At the moment when inpulsive feelings overrides the rational, the amygdala is pivotal. Incomming signals from the sense let the amygdala scan every experience for trouble.  This put the amydala in a powerful post in mental life.
		- Whenever the situation is dangerous or challenging, the amydala reacts instantaneously like a neutal tripwire, telegraphing a message of crisis to all parts of the brain. While in this situation, the brain will aslo scan for the experienced situtions happeded berfore.
	- The emotional sentinel
		- With the privilege of the brain structure, the amygdala is the first part to take response to the emergency situation, then it will send the signal to the neocortext where the respone is fully perceived and initiated it more finely.
		- Amygdala is aslo memorize the situation for whenever needed to trigger the memory to quickly react.
		- ***" A visual signal first goes from the retina to the thalamus, where it is translated into the language of the brain. Most of the message then goes to the visual cortex, where it is analyzed and assessed for meaning and appropriate response; if that response is emotional, a signal goes to the amygdala to activate the emotional centers. But a smaller portion of the original signal goes straight from the thalamus to the amygdala in a quicker transmission, allowing a faster (though less precise) response. Thus, the amygdala can trigger an emotional response before the cortical centers have fully understood what is happening."***
	- The specialist in emotional memory
		- Memories are stored in 2 places:
			- Hippocampus: is where the memories are stored in a logical form like shape, color, ...
			- Amygdala: is where the memories are stored in feeling form.
		- These 2 places combine, human has ability to memorize the feelings, where, when, what happend.
	- Out-of-date neural alarms:
		- The emotional storage - amygdala scan for memories, comparing what happening now with what happened in the past. This comparision of sloppy because of the fast react to the situation.
		- In the modern world, things are changing with fast, where the amygdala is not able to catch up. What is dangerous back then maybe now not dangeruos anymore and the amygdala mechanism is not fully analyze income signal made it response wrong.
		- Since the earliest emotional memories are establised at the time before infants have words for their experience, when these emotional memories are triggered in later life there is not a matching set of articulated thoughs about the response that take us over.
