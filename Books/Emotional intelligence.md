### Part 1: The emotional brain
1. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Chapter 1: What are emotions for?</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When passions overwhelm reason: </mark>
		- Everytimes emotion makes a decision, it is the instinct of the hunman. Through time, it was developed through survival and till now it is not keeping up with the modern world.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Impules to action:</mark>
		- Anger
		- Fear
		- Happiness
		- Love
		- Surprise
		- Disgust
		- Sadness
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Our two minds:</mark>
		- Rational : the logical brain
		- Emotional mind: the heart
	- How did your brain grew?
2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Anatomy of an Emotional hjacking</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The seat of all passion</mark>
		- In hunmans, the amygdala (from the Greek word for "almond") is an almond-shape cluster of interconnected structyures perched above the brainstem. If hunman lost amydala, they can no longer have feeling for others and all the passions.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The neural tripwire</mark>
		- At the moment when inpulsive feelings overrides the rational, the amygdala is pivotal. Incomming signals from the sense let the amygdala scan every experience for trouble.  This put the amydala in a powerful post in mental life.
		- Whenever the situation is dangerous or challenging, the amydala reacts instantaneously like a neutal tripwire, telegraphing a message of crisis to all parts of the brain. While in this situation, the brain will aslo scan for the experienced situtions happeded berfore.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The emotional sentinel</mark>
		- With the privilege of the brain structure, the amygdala is the first part to take response to the emergency situation, then it will send the signal to the neocortext where the respone is fully perceived and initiated it more finely.
		- Amygdala is aslo memorize the situation for whenever needed to trigger the memory to quickly react.
		- ***" A visual signal first goes from the retina to the thalamus, where it is translated into the language of the brain. Most of the message then goes to the visual cortex, where it is analyzed and assessed for meaning and appropriate response; if that response is emotional, a signal goes to the amygdala to activate the emotional centers. But a smaller portion of the original signal goes straight from the thalamus to the amygdala in a quicker transmission, allowing a faster (though less precise) response. Thus, the amygdala can trigger an emotional response before the cortical centers have fully understood what is happening."***
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The specialist in emotional memory</mark>
		- Memories are stored in 2 places:
			- Hippocampus: is where the memories are stored in a logical form like shape, color, ...
			- Amygdala: is where the memories are stored in feeling form.
		- These 2 places combine, human has ability to memorize the feelings, where, when, what happend.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Out-of-date neural alarms:</mark>
		- The emotional storage - amygdala scan for memories, comparing what happening now with what happened in the past. This comparision of sloppy because of the fast react to the situation.
		- In the modern world, things are changing with fast, where the amygdala is not able to catch up. What is dangerous back then maybe now not dangeruos anymore and the amygdala mechanism is not fully analyze income signal made it response wrong.
		- Since the earliest emotional memories are establised at the time before infants have words for their experience, when these emotional memories are triggered in later life there is not a matching set of articulated thoughs about the response that take us over.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When emotionals are fast and sloppy</mark>
		- Whenever a event trigger the brain to react, a part of the signal is sent to the amygdala  in a shortcut circuit to analyze the situation you are against, rest of the signal is sent to the neocortex to have a deeper analyze. This shortcut is curcial for the hunman survival, it will trigger emotional impluses in matter of nano seconds. This helps alert the brain to make a survival decision, ***"you don't need to know exactly what something is to know that it may be dangerous"***. But sometimes fast doesn't make the good solution.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The emotional manager</mark>
		- ***" If the amygdala often acts as an emergency trigger, the left prefrontal lobe appears to be part of the brain’s “off” switch for disturbing emotion: the amygdala proposes, the prefrontal lobe disposes. These prefrontal-limbic connections are crucial in mental life far beyond fine-tuning emotion; they are essential for navigating us through the decisions that matter most in life."***
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Harmonizing emotion and thought</mark>
		- We have two brains, two minds - and two different kinds of intelligence: rational and emotional. Our decision in life is determined by both rational and intelligence. When these two partners interact well, emotional inteliigence rises - as does intellectual ability.
