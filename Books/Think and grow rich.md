## Desire
- The methods which help desire rich:
	1. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It's not suufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money". Be definite as to the amount.
	2. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire.
	3. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire.
	4. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan in action.
	5. Write out a clear, consise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describle clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.
	6. Read your writeen statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ - SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF, ALREADY IN PROCESSION OF THE MONEY.
## Faith
- Thoughts which are mixed with any of the feelings or emotions, constitute a "magnetic" force which attracts, from the vibrations of the ehter, other similar, or realated thoughts.
- Self-confidence formular
	- I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of Definite purpose in life, therefore, I demand of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.
	- I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minute daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, therby creating in my mind a clear metal picture of that person.
	- I know throught the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some pratical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily demanding of myself the developemt of self-confidence.
	- I have clearly written down a description of my definite chief aim in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.
	-  I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.
## Auto-suggestion
- Sumary of instructions:
	1. Go into some quiet spot. Imagine yourself already got what you want and what you have given to return.
	2. Repeat this program night and morning until you can see, (in imagination) the money you intend to accumulate.
	3. Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring and upon arising until it has been memorized.
## Specialized knowedge
- How to organize and use knowledge after you acquire it?
- Knowledge has no value except that which can be gained from its application toward some worthy end. This is one reason why college degrees are not valued more highly. They represent nothing but meiscellaneous knowledge.
- The strange thing about human beings is that they value only that which has a price. Why the system is built for education totally free but there still many people don't go to school?
- It pays to know how to purchase knowledge!
