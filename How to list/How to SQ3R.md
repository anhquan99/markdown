- **Survey**: Read all the key terms, headings, pictures, ... quickly.
- **Question**: if there is a question in the end of the chapter, then go for it first, then you will have to search for answers.
- **Rephrase**: take note with your own words from complex to simple that 5 years old kid can understand.
- **Recall**: look back all your question and try to answer it without looking at the answer. (Flashcard)
- **Repetition**: make time for recall in an amount of time for the brain to digest information.
