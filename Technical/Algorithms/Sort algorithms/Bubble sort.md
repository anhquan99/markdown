# Idea
- Compare 2 element next to each other if the preceding element smaller the current element then swap position of 2 elements.
- Repeat until no more pair element is left.
- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$ 
# Advantages
- Easy to code and understand
- No more memory required
# Disadvantages
- Big time complexity for big input data.
# Coding
