# MVC pattern
- Model-View-Controller architecture pattern separates an application into 3 main groups of components
- Helps to archive separation of concerns.
- Easier to code, debug, and test.
- View and controller depend on model. Model does not depend on view or controller.
- **Model**: 
- **View:** responsible for presenting content through the user interface.
- **Controller:** handle user interaction, work with the model and select a view to render. The controller is the initial entry point, and is responsible for selecting which model types to work with and which view to render.
# Separation of concerns
- Software should be separated based on the kinds of work it performs.
