# Ingredients of Effective Modeling
1. *Binding the model and the implementation.* That crude prototype forged the essential link early, and it was maintained through all subsequent iterations.
2. *Cultivating a language based on the model.*
3. *Developing a knowledge-rich model.* The objects had behavior and enforced rules. The model wasn't just a data schema; it was integral to solve a complex problem. It captured knowledge of various kinds.
4. *Distilling the model.* Important concepts were added to the model as it became more complete, but equally important, concepts were dropped when they didn't prove useful or central. When an unneeded concept was tied to one that was needed, a new model was found that distinguished the essential concept so that the other could be dropped.
5. *Brainstorming and experimenting.* The language, combined with sketches and a brainstorming attitude, turned our discussions into laboratories of the model, in which hundreds of experimental variations could be exercised, tried, and judged. As the team went through scenarios, the spoken expressions themselves provided a quick viability test of a proposed model, as the ear could quickly detect either the clarity and ease or the awkwardness of expression.
# Knowledge-Rich Design
- Business activities and rules are as central to a domain as are the entities involved; any domain will have various categories of concepts. Knowledge crunching yields models that reflect this kind of insight. In parallel with model changes, developers refactor the implementation to express the model, giving the application use of that knowledge.
# Deep Models
- Useful models seldom lie on the surface. As we come to understand the domain and the needs of the application, we usually discard superficial model elements that seemed important in the beginning, or we shift their perspective.
- Subtle abstractions emerge that would not have occurred to us at the outset but that pierce to the heart of the matter.
