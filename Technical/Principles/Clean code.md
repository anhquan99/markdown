# Principles
## Right tool for right job
- Stay native benefit:
	- Cached 
	- Code colored
	- Syntax checked
	- Separation of concerns
	- Reusable
	- Avoid string parsing
- How to do:
	- Avoid using one language to write another language
	- Leverage libraries
	- One language per life
## Maximize signal to noise ratio
- **Signal** follow TED rules
	- Terse: short and easy to read
	- Expressive: easy to understand
	- Do one thing
## Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- Copy and paste is often a sign of a design problem
- Refactor code
## Self-documenting code
- Clear intent
- Layers of abstraction should be used
- Format for readability
- Favor code over comments when possible
## Naming
- Class
	- Noun
	- Be specific
	- Single responsibility
	- Avoid generic suffixes
- Methods
	- A good name is one so descriptive that the reader does not have to read the Method to know that it does
	- Warning signs for spliting method:
		- And
		- Or
		- If
	- Watch for Side effects, refactor until the method name completely describes what it does
	- Avoid abbreviations
# Conditions
- Boolean comparisons: short and positive comparison
- Boolean assignments: make it short by using ternary
- Positive conditionals
- Ternary is elegant
- Avoid being "Stringly" typed: use enum instead type string
- Magic numbers: we don't know if some random number is existed in the code
- Complex conditionals fix:
	- Intermdeiate variable
	- Encapsulate via function
- Favor Polymorphism over Enum and Function
- Be declarative if possible
- Sometimes code isn't the answer, alternative non coding solution maybe better than code
# Function
- When to create a function:
	- Duplication
	- Indentation >= 3 level
	- Unclear intent
	- Bigger than 1 task
	- Sign it's too long
		- Whitespace & comments
		- Scrolling required
		- Naming issues
		- Multiple conditional
		- Hard to digest
	- Try/Catch fail slow
- # Refactor function
	- Return early
	- Fail fast
	- Convey intent
	- Do one thing
	- Mayfly variables
		- Initialize variables just-in-time
		- Do 1 thing
	- Strive for 0–3 parameters
	- Watch for flag arguments - a sign the function doing 2 things
# Classes
- When to create
	- New concept
	- Low Cohesion
	- Promote reuse
	- Reduce complexity
	- Clarify parameters
- Cohesion - Strongly related methods
- When is a class to small?
	-  Inappropriate intimacy
	- Feature envy
	- Too many pieces
- Primitive obsession
	- Helps reader conceptualize
	- Implicit → Explicit
	- Encapsulation
	- Aids maintenance
- Principle of Proximity
	- Strive to make code read from top to bottom when possible
	- Keep related actions together
# Comments
- These can be a signal or a noise, depend on how the programer use it.
- Rules:
	- Prefer expressive code over comments
	- Use comments when code alone can't be sufficient
- TODO comment
- Summary comment
- Documentation comment
