- While doing a task, the consumer may have errors and the task is partly done and never be done.
- In that case, we want to send the message to another consumer. RabbitMQ supports message acknowledgements.
- **An ack is sent back by the consumer** to tell RabbitMQ the message has been received, processed and RabbitMQ is free to delete it.
- **If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack**, RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.
- RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release any untracked messages.
