# Requirement And Design
- Once the product owner approves the `intent.md`, Claude takes it and produces a requirements and design spec. This is guided by the organization's skills for brand, security, compliance, and UX.
- The product owner reviews that spec, but doesn't write it. The goal of this process is to create a spec the engineering team can plan against, with flagged areas of concern.

|Requirements and design are separate phases run by separate teams. Analysts formalize the idea into requirements, and designers then parse those back into a design. The separation exists for accountability, but it is slow and lossy.|Both phases happen in a single prompted session. Claude takes `intent.md` and produces a requirements and design spec, constrained by the organization's skills, with areas of concern flagged.|
## Execution
1. The product owner opens a session with the organization's skills available and attaches the `intent.md`.
2. The product owner's prompt points at the intent, names the constraints, and demands flagged concerns. Run it by hand at first, then codify it as an organization-level slash command. From there make the acceptance of `intent.md` in the intent home the trigger, with a non-interactive job that fires on the merge, runs the pass with the organization's skills loaded, and commits `spec.md` as a pull request (the CI/CD play in **Stage 5: Deploy** covers the plumbing). From that point the product owner's first involvement is the review.
3. The same product owner reviews the spec against the idea. Does the spec solve the stated problem, and are the open questions from `intent.md` answered or carried forward?
4. Work through the flagged concerns first as they are the points an analyst would have escalated. The product owner resolves each one with its policy owner before engineering sees the spec.
5. Commit `spec.md` alongside `intent.md`. The file pair records what was asked for and what was decided.
6. The product owner decides whether the spec and intent progress to build, consulting a technical lead for anything the organization classes as higher risk. A human teammate always makes this call, and accepting the spec is what starts the plan mode play in **Stage 3: Build**.
## Example
```
Read the attached intent.md and produce a requirements and design spec for integrating it into our existing codebase. Apply the skills available to you so the plan conforms to our brand guidelines, security policies and UX standards. Document the spec fully as spec.md, ready to hand to the engineering team. Describe clearly any areas of concern, especially where you cannot satisfy contradicting policies.
```
## How to measure it
- **Leading indicator**: Elapsed time between the `intent.md` commit and the `spec.md` commit for the same change (two Git timestamps), compared with the old requirements-plus-design cycle.
- **Lagging indicator**: Requirements rework after build starts. Count `spec.md` commits dated after the first `plan.md` commit for the same change. Git log will give this directly.
