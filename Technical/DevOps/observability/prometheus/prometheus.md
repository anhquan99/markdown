# Prometheus
## Observability
- The ability to understand and measure the state of a system based upon data generated by the system.
## Architecture
- Retrieval: scapes metric data.
- TSDB: store metric data.
- HTTP server: accept PromQL query.
- Exporter: collect metric and expose them in a format Prometheus expects.
```ad-note
Prometheus follows a pull based model, which mean it will pull data from target and it needs to have a list of targets it should scrape.
```

## Data
### Logs
- Logs are records of events that have occurred and encapsulate information about the specific event.
#### Structure
- Timestamp
- Message containing information
### Traces
- Traces allow you to follow operations as they traverses through various system and services.
#### Structure
- Start time
- Duration
- Parent ID
### Metrics 
- Metrics provide information about the state of a system using numerical values:
	- CPU load
	- Number of open files
	- HTTP response times
	- Number of errors
#### Structure
- Metric name
- Value
- Timestamp
- Dimensions - additional information about the metricw
## Service level
### Service level indicator (SLI)
- A quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.
- Common SLIs:
	- Request latency
	- Error rate
	- Saturation
	- Throughput
	- Availability
### Service level objective (SLO)
- Target level for SLI.
- Ex:
	- SLI: availability
	- SLO: 99% uptime
### Service level agreement (SLA)
- A contract between a vendor and a user that guarantees certain of SLO.
