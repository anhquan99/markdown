# Provision VMs in Azure
- Considerations when provisioning VMs:
	- Availability
		- You should avoid running a production workload on a single VM, it wouldn't be resilient in the face of planned or unplanned maintenance.
		- Fault domains: logical groups of hardware within a data center that share the same power and network hardware. Limitation is the impact of physical hardware failures and power interruptions.
		- Update domains: are logical groups of hardware within a data center that might undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. Only 1 update domain is rebooted at any 1 time and given 30 minutes to recover before maintenance is initiated across multiple update domains to increase availability.
		- Infrastructure redundancy selections:
			- Availability zones
			- Virtual machine scale sets: distributing VMs across multiple availability zones and fault domains.
			- Availability sets:  are logical groups of VMs within a data center, where VMs are distributed across fault domains and update domains. Availability sets themselves don't carry any costs, you only need to pay the VM instances that you create.
	- Disks
		- Disk type:
			- Standard: cost effective for development and testing.
			- Premium: for production.
		- Disk storage:
			- Managed disk: managed by Azure.
			- Unmanaged disk: managed by yourself.
	- Limits: CPUs limits
	- Location
	- Naming: naming conventions for VMs.
	- Operating system image
	- Post-provision configuration
	- Size
	- Pricing model
