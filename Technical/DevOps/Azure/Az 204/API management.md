# Components:
- API gateway:
	- Accepts API call and routes them to appropriate backends.
	- Verifies API keys and other credentials presented with requests.
	- Enforces usage quotas and rate limits.
	- Transforms requests and responses specified in policy statements.
	- Caches responses to improve response latency and minimize the load on backend services.
	- Emits log, metrics and traces for monitoring, reporting and troubleshooting.
- Management plane:
	- Provision and configure API management service settings.
	- Define or import API schema.
	- Package APIs into products.
	- Setup policies like quotas or transformations on the API.
	- Get insights from analytics.
	- Manage users.
- Developer portal:
	- Read API documentation.
	- Call an API via the interactive console.
	- Create an account and subscribe to get API keys.
	- Access analytics on their own usage.
	- Download API definitions.
	- Manage API keys.
# Polices:
- Control flow: conditionally applies policy statements based on the results of the evaluation of Boolean expressions.
- Forward request: forward request to a backend service.
- Limit concurrency: prevents executing more than specified number of request at a time.
- Log to Event Hub: sends messages in the specified format to an Event Hub defined by a Logger entity.
- Mock response: aborts pipeline execution and return a mocked response.
- Retry: retries execution of the enclosed policy statements, if and until the condition is met. Execution will repeat at the specified time intervals and up to the specified retry count.
