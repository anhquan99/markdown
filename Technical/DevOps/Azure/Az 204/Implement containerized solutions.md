# Azure container registry (ACR)
- Use cases
	- Scalable orchestration system that manage containerized applications across clusters of host, including K8s, DC/OS and Docker Swarm.
	- Azure services that support building and running applications at scale, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Service, Batch, Service Fabric, ...
- Tier
	- Basic: provide the same with 2 other tiers ( Azure Active Directory authentication integration, image deletion, and webhooks) for learning and lower usage scenarios.
	- Standard: provide increased storage and image throughput.
	- Premium: provide the highest amount of resources, adding feature such as geo-replication for managing a single registry across multiple regions, content trust for image tag signing, and private endpoints to restrict access to the registry.
- Storage capabilities
	- Encryption-at-rest: Azure automatically encrypts an image before storing it, and decrypts it on the fly.
	- Regional storage: ACR stores data in the region where the registry is created, except for some regions. If a regional outage occurs, the registry data may become unavailable and isn't automatically recovered, this issue is solved by geo-replication.
	- Zone redundancy: premium service tier feature, replicate your registry to a minimum of 3 separate zones in each enabled region.
	- Scalable strage.
- ACR Tasks 
	- Quick task: build and push a single container image to a container registry on-demand without needing a local Docker Engine installation. Think `docker build`, `docker push` in the cloud.
	- Automatically triggered tasks: build image base on triggers
		- Trigger on source code update: when the code repository updated, an ACR Task creates webhook trigger a build of the container image defined in the repo.
		- Trigger on base image update: when the updated base image is pushed to your registry, or a base image is updated in a public repo, ACR Tasks can automatically build any application image based on it.
		- Trigger on a schedule: useful for running container workloads on a defined schedule, or running maintenance operations or tests on images pushed regularly to your registry.
- Image platforms

		- amd64
