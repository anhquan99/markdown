# Azure container registry (ACR)
- Use cases
	- Scalable orchestration system that manage containerized applications across clusters of host, including K8s, DC/OS and Docker Swarm.
	- Azure services that support building and running applications at scale, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Service, Batch, Service Fabric, ...
- Tier
	- Basic: provide the same with 2 other tiers ( Azure Active Directory authentication integration, image deletion, and webhooks) for learning and lower usage scenarios.
	- Standard: provide increased storage and image throughput.
	- Premium: provide the highest amount of resources, adding feature such as geo-replication for managing a single registry across multiple regions, content trust for image tag signing, and private endpoints to restrict access to the registry.
- Storage capabilities
	- Encryption-at-rest: Azure automatically encrypts an image before storing it, and decrypts it on the fly.
	- Regional storage: ACR stores data in the region where the registry is created, except for some regions. If a regional outage occurs, the registry data may become unavailable and isn't automatically recovered, this issue is solved by geo-replication.
	- Zone redundancy: premium service tier feature, replicate your registry to a minimum of 3 separate zones in each enabled region.
	- Scalable stage.
- ACR Tasks 
	- Quick task: build and push a single container image to a container registry on-demand without needing a local Docker Engine installation. Think `docker build`, `docker push` in the cloud.
	- Automatically triggered tasks: build image base on triggers
		- Trigger on source code update: when the code repository updated, an ACR Task creates webhook trigger a build of the container image defined in the repo.
		- Trigger on base image update: when the updated base image is pushed to your registry, or a base image is updated in a public repo, ACR Tasks can automatically build any application image based on it.
		- Trigger on a schedule: useful for running container workloads on a defined schedule, or running maintenance operations or tests on images pushed regularly to your registry.
- Image platforms
	- Linux:
		- amd64
		- arm
		- arm64
		- 486
	- Windows:
		- amd64
# Azure container instances (ACI)
- Solution for isolated container, example simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.
- Benefits:
	- Fast startup.
	- Container access: ACI enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
	- Hypervisor-level security.
	- Customer data: stores the minimum customer data required to ensure your container groups are running as expected.
	- Custom sizes.
	- Persistent storage.
	- Linux and Windows: schedule both Windows and Linux containers using the same API.
- Container groups are collections of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. It's like pod in k8s (only available on Linux).
	- Deployment:
		- Resource Manager template.
		- YAML file.
	- Common scenarios:
		- A container serving a web application and a container pulling the latest content from source control.
		- An application container and a logging container.
		- An application container anda a monitoring container.
		- A front-end container and a back-end container.
# Azure container apps
- Azure container app enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform that runs on top of Azure k8s service. Common uses:
	- Deploying API endpoints.
	- Hosting background processing applications.
	- Handling event-driven processing.
	- Running microservices.
- Azure container Apps manages the details of k8s and container orchestration for you.
