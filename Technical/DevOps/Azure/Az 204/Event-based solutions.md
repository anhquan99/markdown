- Azure event Grid is a serverless event broker that you can use to integrate applications using events
- 5 concepts in event grid
	- Event: what happened.
	- Event sources: where the event took place.
	- Topic: the endpoint publishers send events.
	- Event subscriptions: the event router, it can route to multiple handler. Subscriptions are also used by handler to filter incoming request.
	- Event handler: the app or service to handle event.
- Event schemas:
	- Event schema: use `"content-type" : "application/json; charset=utf-8` 
	- Cloud schema: use `"content-type" : "application/cloudevents+json"`
- Event delivery durability:
	- Note: event grid doesn't guarantee order for event delivery, so subscribers may receive them out of order.
	- Retry schedule:
		- If error occur when sending event, event grid will consider dropping the event to dead-letter queue or drop the event. The dead-letter queue is not config by default.
		- Event grid will wait for 30 seconds for the response, after 30 seconds the event grid will retry. Event grid uses an exponential backoff retry policy.
	- Retry policy:
		- Maximum number of attempts: must be 1 to 30, default value is 30.
		- Event time to live (TTL): must be 1 to 1440, default value is 1440 minutes.
	- Output batching:
		- Max events per batch
		- Preferred batch size in kilobytes
	- Delayed delivery: if an endpoint experiences delivery failures, event grid begin to delay the delivery and retry.
	- Dead-letter event: after a certain time of retries or TTL, the event is sent to a storage account.
- Control access to events
	- Build-in roles
		- Event grid subscription reader: lets you read event grid event subscriptions.
		- Event grid subscription contributor: lets you manage event grid event subscription operations.
		- Event grid contributor: lets you create and manage event grid resources.
		- Event grid data sender: lets you send events to event grid topics.
	- Permissions for event subscriptions: for event handler isn't a WebHook (such as an event hub or queue storage)
		- System topics: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`
		- Custom topics: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{topic-name}`
- Filter events
	- Event type filtering
	- Subject filtering
	- Advanced filtering
