# Implement containerized solutions
- Azure container registry (ACR)
	- Use cases
		- Scalable orchestration system that manage containerized applications across clusters of host, including K8s, DC/OS and Docker Swarm.
		- Azure services that support building and running applications at scale, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Service, Batch, Service Fabric, ...
	- Tier
		- Basic: provide the same with 2 other tiers ( Azure Active Directory authentication integration, image deletion, and webhooks) for learning and lower usage scenarios.
		- Standard: provide increased storage and image throughput.
		- Premium: provide the highest amount of resources, adding feature such as geo-replication for managing a single registry across multiple regions, content trust for image tag signing, and private endpoints to restrict access to the registry.
	- Storage capabilities
		- Encryption-at-rest: Azure automatically encrypts an image before storing it, and decrypts it on the fly.
		- Regional storage: ACR stores data in the region where the registry is created, except for some regions. If a regional outage occurs, the registry data may become unavailable and isn't automatically recovered, this issue is solved by geo-replication.
		- Zone redundancy: premium service tier feature, replicate your registry to a minimum of 3 separate zones in each enabled region.
		- Scalable strage.
	- ACR Tasks 
		- Quick task: build and push a single container image to a container registry on-demand without needing a local Docker Engine installation. Think `docker build`, `docker push` in the cloud.
		- Automatically triggered tasks: build image base on triggers
			- Trigger on source code update: when the code repository updated, an ACR Task creates webhook trigger a build of the container image defined in the repo.
			- Trigger on base image update: when the updated base image is pushed to your registry, or a base image is updated in a public repo, ACR Tasks can automatically build any application image based on it.
			- Trigger on a schedule: useful for running container workloads on a defined schedule, or running maintenance operations or tests on images pushed regularly to your registry.
	- Image platforms
		- Linux:
			- amd64
			- arm
			- arm64
			- 486
		- Windows:
			- amd64
# Implement Azure Service web apps
- Support service
	- Built-in auto-scale support: depending on the usage of the web app, the web service itself can scale up/down or scale out/in.
	- CI/CD
	- Deployment slots
	- App Service on Linux
- Limitations:
	- App Service on Linux is not supported on Shared pricing tier.
- App Service plan defines:
	- OS
	- Region
	- Number of VM instances
	- Size of VM instances
	- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)
- Runs and scales (except for Free and Shared tier)
	- An app runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
	- If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances.
	- If you have multiple deployment slots for an app, all deployment slots also run on the same VM instances.
	- If you enable diagnostic logs, perform backups, or run WebJobs, they also use CPU cycles and memory on these VM instances.
- Deployment
	- Automated deployment
	- Manual deployment
- Built-in authentication
	- How it works?
		- Authenticates users and clients with the specified identity provider(s)
		- Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens issued by the configured identity provider(s)
		- Manages the authenticated session
		- Injects identity information into HTTP request headers
