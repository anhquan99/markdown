# Kubernetes Federation
With [Kubernetes Cluster Federation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/README) we can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control plane. We can sync resources across the federated clusters and have cross-cluster discovery. This allows us to perform Deployments across regions, access them using a global DNS record, and achieve High Availability. 

Although still a Beta feature, the Federation is very useful when we want to build a hybrid solution, with one cluster running inside our private datacenter and another one in the public cloud, allowing us to avoid provider lock-in. We can also assign weights for each cluster in the Federation, to distribute the load based on custom rules.
