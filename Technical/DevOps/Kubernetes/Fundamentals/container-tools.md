# Container Tools
- [Docker](Docker.md): Container runtime and tool for managing containers and images
- `Containerd`: Container runtime
- `Crictl`: CLI for CRI-compatible Container Runtimes
- `Podman`: Tools for managing containers and images
- `dockershim`: A small software shim (`dockershim`) was introduced as part of the `kubelet` component specifically to fill in the gaps between Docker Engine and CRI.
