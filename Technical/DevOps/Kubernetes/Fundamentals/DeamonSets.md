# DeamonSets
- Resemble [[replicaSets]] and [[deployments]] operators when managing multiple Pod replicas and application updates, but DeamonSets present a distinct feature that enforces a single Pod replica to be placed per Node, on all the Node. **The ReplicaSet and Deployment by default have no control over the scheduling and placement of multiple Pod replicas on the same node**.
- Commonly used in cases when we need to collect monitoring data from all Nodes, or to run a storage, networking, or proxy deamons on all Nodes, to ensure that we have a specific type of Pod running on all Nodes at all times.
- Whenever a Node is added to the cluster, a Pod from a given DeamonSet is automatically placed on it. When any one Node crashed or it is removed from the cluster, the respective DeamonSet operated Pods are garbage collected, If a DeamonSet is deleted all Pod replicas it created are deleted as well.
