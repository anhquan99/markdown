# Processes
- A process is an instance of one or more related tasks (threads) executing on your computer.
- A single command may actually start several processes simultaneously.
- Some processes are independent of each other and others are related. A failure of one process may or may not affect the others running on the system.
- Processes use many system resources, such as memory, CPU (central processing unit) cycles, and peripheral devices, such as network cards, hard drives, printers, and displays. 
- The operating system (especially the kernel) is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimized system utilization.
## Types
| Process type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Examples            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Interactive processes | Need to be started by a user, either at a command line or graphical interface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | bash, firefox       |
| Batch processes       | Automatic process which are scheduled from and then disconnected from the terminal. These task are queued and work on a FIFO basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | updatedb, Idconfig  |
| Daemons               | Server processes that run continuously. Many are launched during system startup and then wait for a user or system request indicating that their service is required.                                                                                                                                                                                      | httpd, sshd         |
| Threads               | Lightweight processes. These are tasks that run under the umbrella of a main process, sharing memory and other resources, but are scheduled and run by the system on an individual basis. An individual thread can end without terminating the whole process and a process an create new thread at any time. Many non-trivial programs are multi-threaded. | dconf-service       |
| Kernel threads        | Kernel tasks that users neither start nor terminate and have little control over. These may perform action like moving a thread from 1 CPU to another, or making sure IO operations to disk are completed.                                                                                                                                                 | kthreadd, migration |
# Scheduler
- A critical kernel function called the scheduler constantly shifts processes on and off the CPU, sharing time according to relative priority, how much time is needed and how much has already been granted to a task.
# States
- When a process is in a running state, it means it is either currently executing instructions on a CPU, or is waiting to be granted a share of time (a time slice) so it can be executed which is resided in a run queue. With the multiple CPUs, there is a run queue on each.
- Sleep state is when a process is waiting for something to happen before they can resume, like user input, etc ...
- Sometimes, a child process completes, but its parent process has not asked about its state, which is called zombie state. It is not really alive, but still shows up in the system's list of processes.
