# Processes
- A process is an instance of one or more related tasks (threads) executing on your computer.
- A single command may actually start several processes simultaneously.
- Some processes are independent of each other and others are related. A failure of one process may or may not affect the others running on the system.
- Processes use many system resources, such as memory, CPU (central processing unit) cycles, and peripheral devices, such as network cards, hard drives, printers, and displays. 
- The operating system (especially the kernel) is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimized system utilization.

| Process type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Examples            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Interactive processes | Need to be started by a user, either at a command line or graphical interface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | bash, firefox       |
| Batch processes       | Automatic process which are scheduled from and then disconnected from the terminal. These task are queued and work on a FIFO basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | updatedb, Idconfig  |
| Daemons               | Server processes that run continuously. Many are launched during system startup and then wait for a user or system request indicating that their service is required.                                                                                                                                                                                      | httpd, sshd         |
| Threads               | Lightweight processes. These are tasks that run under the umbrella of a main process, sharing memory and other resources, but are scheduled and run by the system on an individual basis. An individual thread can end without terminating the whole process and a process an create new thread at any time. Many non-trivial programs are multi-threaded. | dconf-service       |
| Kernel threads        | Kernel tasks that users neither start nor terminate and have little control over. These may perform action like moving a thread from 1 CPU to another, or making sure IO operations to disk are completed.                                                                                                                                                 | kthreadd, migration |
