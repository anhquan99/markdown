# Idea
- Modular and structured approach to define business rule and combining them in the application. This allows you to makе your sourcе codе easier to maintain, tеst, and rеuse whilе еncapsulating businеss rulеs inside spеcification objеcts.
- Isolate the validation logic from the business entity to which it is applied. This is accomplished by introducing a specification object that encapsulates a condition and exposes a method for determining whether a particular object satisfies it.
# Benefits
- Modularize code
- Improving reusability
- Dynamic composition: able for user to combine using logical operators to create complex conditions. Combining multiple specifications allows you to create dynamic queries or filters.
- Streamline testing: specifications represent individual business rules, making them easy to test in isolation. As a result, unit tests are easier to write and the validation logic is more robust
