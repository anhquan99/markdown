# Graph types
- Singular undirected graph
- Undirected multi graph
- Singular directed graph
- Directed multi graph
- We usually use **singular undirected graph** and **directed multi graph**
- $G=<V,E>$ with V is **Vertex set** and E is **Edge set**.
# Vertex tier
- In undirected graph, vertex tier is the number of edges connect with the vertex
- In directed graph, vertex outer tier is the number of edges goes out from that vertex and vertex inner tier is the number of edges goes in that vertex.
